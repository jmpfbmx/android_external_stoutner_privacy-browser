git clone https://git.stoutner.com/PrivacyBrowserROMIntegration.git

The purpose of this repo is to make it easy to integrate Privacy Browser into ROMs.  It is updated with each release of Privacy Browser.

Feature requests and bug reports can be submitted at https://redmine.stoutner.com/projects/privacy-browser-rom-integration.

To integrate Privacy Browser into a ROM build, add the following lines to the build manifest:

<remote name="stoutner" fetch="https://git.stoutner.com" />
<project path="external/stoutner/privacy-browser" remote="stoutner" name="PrivacyBrowserROMIntegration.git" revision="master" />

The sample Android.mk file replaces the `Browser` or `Browser2` package from AOSP.
If you have removed them from your build manifest, you need to add the following statement to your device configuration:

PRODUCT_PACKAGES += privacy-browser
